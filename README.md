# Menu-Simulator
Multiple pages for all of your menu needs
10/18: Began to work on the goon object. I still need to think about every functionality this class needs to do. Removed Bottom Navigation for now
10/19: The Goon object now has a solid structure. Next up will be the move list/object and the item list/object
10/21: The stat increase formula now relies on a single int instead of an int array
10/21 (2): Added types and moves class. Types are pretty much done but moves still have some work. They aren't 100% usefull for this project though so I might save them for later. I at least need a list of move names though
10/23: Begining work on the canvas. (2) The canvas is having problems loading and I am very tired so I'll figure it out tomorrow
10/24: The canvas is now fully funtional! On to the fun part of finishing the menu
10/25: Added Second Page
