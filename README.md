# Menu-Simulator
Multiple pages for all of your menu needs
10/18: Began to work on the goon object. I still need to think about every functionality this class needs to do. Removed Bottom Navigation for now
10/19: The Goon object now has a solid structure. Next up will be the move list/object and the item list/object
10/21: The stat increase formula now relies on a single int instead of an int array
10/21 (2): Added types and moves class. Types are pretty much done but moves still have some work. They aren't 100% usefull for this project though so I might save them for later. I at least need a list of move names though
10/23: Begining work on the canvas. (2) The canvas is having problems loading and I am very tired so I'll figure it out tomorrow
10/24: The canvas is now fully funtional! On to the fun part of finishing the menu
10/25: Added Second Page
10/27: The informaton about stats now has a functional menu. Up next are moves 
10/28: Goons now have a typing. For now I think that is all

On the surface this project doesn't look that impressive. If you wanted to recreate these screenshots 
it probably wouldn't be too difficult. Most of the time spent on this project was on the background structure that 
allows for the addition of new pages and goons (without much more implementation). There might be only three now, 
but you could add thousands if you wanted to with ease.
