# Menu-Simulator
Multiple pages for all of your menu needs
10/18: Began to work on the goon object. I still need to think about every functionality this class needs to do. Removed Bottom Navigation for now
10/19: The Goon object now has a solid structure. Next up will be the move list/object and the item list/object
10/21: The stat increase formula now relies on a single int instead of an int array
